This project provides a simple example of how supervised learning techniques, linear Regression.

The code was written with a notebook.

### Introduction
In supervised learning problems, statistical models are developed from a dataset with multiple features. Machine learning programs predict an output from the input dataset by learning from pairs of labeled inputs and outputs; that is, the program learns from examples of the right answers. Supervised learning involves modeling the relationship between measured features of the data and some label associated with the data. Once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data for which the labels are unknown.

Supervised learning is subdivided into:

* **Classification** tasks, where labels are discrete categories. <br/>

* **Regression** tasks, where labels are continuous quantities.

### Install packages
Run `pip install requirements.txt`

### Conclusion

This project provides a practical example of applying linear regression to a real-world dataset, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing and model building. By predicting interest rates for loans, we demonstrate the value of supervised learning techniques in understanding and leveraging relationships between variables.
